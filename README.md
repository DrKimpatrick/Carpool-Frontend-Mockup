# Ride-my-way (Carpool Andela Bootcamp 09 Project)

Ride-my-way App is a carpooling application that provides drivers with the ability to create ride oﬀers  and passengers  to join available ride oﬀers.
## Overview
- ## User (s)
The users of the application are travelers and commuters who want to go from one place to 
another or users that are driving a trip and want to find passengers. Users can act as both passengers and 
drivers while using an application

- ### Driver
A driver is any person that owns a car and wants to go from one place to another and publishes 
his trip on the application in order to find passengers to share the ride with.

- ### Passenger
A passenger is any person that doesn’t own a car and wants to join a driver in a trip he posted 
and agrees to all the conditions specified (price and general behavior).
